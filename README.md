<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>

Catering is a niche industry that most consumers don't have experience with until they need it. This creates a market that is hard to approach and often leads to the consumer taking the first offer shot their way. Vendors, whether big or small face the issue of filling as many time slots as possible.
